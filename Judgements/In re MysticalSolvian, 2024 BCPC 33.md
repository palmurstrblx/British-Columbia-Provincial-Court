Rescue Services before including themself in the active chase of a suspect that was fleeing
from a peace officer. As a Vancouver Fire & Rescue Services member, they are issued tools to
help perform their duties. These tools include an Axe. The tool that is issued to the Vancouver
Fire & Rescue Services is not to be used in an attempt to stop a suspect eluding, or any type of
Law Enforcement Duties.

[5] According to the Evidence submitted by the applicant, it shows goldqins chasing a suspect
with an Axe swinging which caused bodily harm to the suspect eluding.

threat towards the accused.

[7] Members of Vancouver Fire & Rescue Services do not have the powers or responsibilities of
law enforcement. It is not within their role to pursue fleeing suspects.

[8] Though the accused stated via gamechat "hits-", the court does not agree that this
constitutes Assault Peace Officer.

[9] The court agrees, that the accused, goldqins, was intentionally applying force to the person
without their explicit consent with an axe, which is recognized as a weapon.

[10] The court agrees, that the accused, goldqins, was offending against public decency and
order, whilst knowing that they were committing these acts in a public place.

[11]The court does not agree with the assertion that the accused, goldqins, was either
committing or threatening to commit an assault on the Deputy. The court finds that Goldqins
neither used nor threatened the Deputy with a weapon or physical force that could cause bodily
harm and or obstruct the Deputy in the performance of their duties.
